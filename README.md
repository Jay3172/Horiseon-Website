Refactor of the Horiseon web page to follow accessibility standards and optimize for search engines.
User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


Changes made
added a more descriptive title
added semantic tags (header, nav, section, article, aside, footer)
changed h3 tags to h2 tags in aside to fix hierarchy and restyled to make the font smaller
added alt text for images
consolidated repetitive css and made selectors more specific
re-organized css to better match sections in html
fixed missing id to make menu link work correctly
commented HTML and CSS for readability and clarity
